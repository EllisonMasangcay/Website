Finals Website
By Ellison
This is my website that I turned in for my finals.

When I first started my website, I had planned to use a website that I had worked on with another person, as a template, but I didn't want to seem like I was just copying, and that I was doing easy work. I then decided to create a website from scratch, and I proceeded to do that, but I found that it wasn't easy.
I then decided to just use a simple template, and I ended up using the w3school templates. Compared to creating a website from scratch, it was so easy. I just needed to style it up a bit, and decided what my actual content was to about.
I decided to do one for a Community that I was personally involved in, because i was involved in it, it would make it easier to create a website for it.
