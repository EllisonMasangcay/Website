Finals Website

This is my website that I turned in for my finals.

When I first started my website, I had planned to use a website that I had worked on with another person, as a template, but I didn't want to seem like I was just copying, and that I was doing easy work. I then decided to create a website from scratch, and I proceeded to do that, but I found that it wasn't easy.
